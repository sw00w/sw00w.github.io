## The Great Dane and the Chihuahua


![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/The_Great_Dane_and_the_Chihuahua.png)

Imagine that you have two dogs: a small Chihuahua and a large Great Dane. The Chihuahua is the client and the Great Dane is the server. The Chihuahua is very strong and can handle a lot of treats at once, but the Great Dane can only handle a few treats at a time.

The TCP window size is like the Great Dane's treat bowl. It's the amount of treats (data) that the Great Dane is willing to receive from the Chihuahua before it gets full and needs a break. When the Great Dane is hungry and ready for more treats, it sends an ACK to the Chihuahua, signaling that it is ready for more.

Now, let's say that the Chihuahua has a really big treat bowl and can handle a lot of treats at once. If the Chihuahua starts dumping its entire treat stash into the bowl all at once, the Great Dane might get overwhelmed and not be able to eat all the treats. This is where "window scaling" comes in. Just like how the Great Dane's treat bowl gets a little bit smaller each time it sends an ACK, the TCP window size can decrease by a certain amount (x) each time the server sends an ACK. This helps to prevent the sender (Chihuahua) from overwhelming the receiver (Great Dane) with too much data at once.
