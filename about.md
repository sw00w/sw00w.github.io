Paws and Protocols: A Network Engineer and Python Fanatic's Tale


Hello internet strangers! I am a network engineer who moonlights as a Python enthusiast. When I'm not busy saving the world from network outages, you can find me trying to teach my dachshunds how to code (spoiler alert: it's not going well). In my free time, I enjoy long walks to the fridge and Netflix marathons on the couch with my furry friends.
